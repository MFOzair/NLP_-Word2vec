Romeo and Juliet Word2Vec Analysis
This project demonstrates the use of Word2Vec to train word embeddings on Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet. It preprocesses the text, removes stop words, and builds a model to identify word similarities and relationships within the text.

Features
Preprocess Text:
Converts text to lowercase.
Removes common English stop words.
Train Word Embeddings:
Uses the Word2Vec model from the gensim library.
Skip-gram model is applied for better performance on smaller datasets.
Vocabulary Exploration:
Inspect the vocabulary generated by the Word2Vec model.
Word Similarity:
Find words similar to a given word (e.g., romeo).
Odd-One-Out Detection:
Identify the word that doesn't fit in a given group of words.
Technologies Used
Python: Main programming language.
NLTK: For text preprocessing and stop word removal.
Gensim: For training the Word2Vec model.
